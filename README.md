# Description
## Killing features
* Unleash the power of Nmap with Masscan for large-scale scans
* Scan targets using domain names and other formats
* Output results in a clean domain:port format
* Stream results to and from other tools using stdin/stdout mode
* Enjoy hassle-free scanning with automatic packet rate adjustment for Masscan
* Generate Nmap XML reports
* Stay focused and on target with scope control

JFScan is a wrapper that leverages the speed of Masscan and Nmap's fingerprinting capabilities. JFScan accepts targets in the form of URLs, domains, or IPs (including CIDR). You can specify a file with targets using an argument, or use stdin.

JFScan also allows you to output only the results and chain them with other tools like Nuclei. The domain:port output of JFScan is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, as the virtual host determines which content will be served.

In addition, JFScan can scan discovered ports with Nmap, and enables you to define custom options and leverage Nmap's advanced scripting capabilities.

  --enable-ipv6         enable IPv6 support, otherwise all IPv6 addresses will be ignored in the scanning process
  --scope SCOPE         file path with IP adresses and CIDRs to control scope, expected format: IPv6, IPv4, IPv6 CIDR, IPv4 CIDR
  -r MAX_RATE, --max-rate MAX_RATE
                        max kpps rate for the masscan
  --wait WAIT           a number of seconds to wait for packets to arrive (when scanning large networks), option for the masscan
  --disable-auto-rate   disable rate adjustment mechanism for masscan (more false positives/negatives)
  -i INTERFACE, --interface INTERFACE
                        interface for masscan and nmap to use
  --source-ip SOURCE_IP
                        IP address of your interface for the masscan
  --router-ip ROUTER_IP

  --version             show program's version number and exit
```

Please follow installation instructions before running. Do not run the JFScan under a root, it's not needed since we set a special permissions on the masscan binary.

## Example
Scan targets for only for ports 80 and 443 with rate of 10 kpps:

`$ jfscan -p 80,443 --targets targets.txt -r 10000`

Scan targets for top 1000 ports :

`$ jfscan --top-ports 1000 1.1.1.1/24`

You can also specify targets on stdin and pipe it to nuclei:

`$ cat targets.txt | jfscan --top-ports 1000 -q | httpx -silent | nuclei`

Or as positional parameter:

`$ jfscan --top-ports 1000 1.1.1.1/24 -q | httpx -silent | nuclei`

Or everything at once, the JFScan just does not care and scans all the targets specified:

`$ echo target1 | jfscan --top-ports 1000 target2 --targets targets.txt -q | httpx -silent | nuclei`

Utilize nmap to gather more info about discovered services:

`$ cat targets.txt | jfscan -p 0-65535 --nmap --nmap-options="-sV --scripts ssh-auth-methods"`

The targets.txt can contain targets in the following forms (IPv6 similarly):
```
http://domain.com/
domain.com
1.2.3.4
1.2.3.0/24
1.1.1.1-1.1.1.30
```

# Installation
1. Before installation, make sure you have the latest version of Masscan installed (tested version is 1.3.2).

First, install a libpcap-dev (Debian based distro) or libcap-devel (Centos based distro):

```
sudo apt install libpcap-dev
```

Next, clone the official repository and install:
```
sudo apt-get --assume-yes install git make gcc
git clone https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan
cd masscan
make
sudo make install
```


1. The Masscan requires root permissions to run. Since running binaries under root is not good idea, we will set a CAP_NET_RAW capability to the binary:

```
sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW+ep /usr/bin/masscan
```

3. For installation of JFscan a python3 and pip3 is required.

```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```

4. Install JFScan:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/nullt3r/jfscan.git
$ cd jfscan
$ pip3 install .
```
If you can't run the jfscan directly from command line you should check if $HOME/.local/bin is in your path.

Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

\* *When scanning smaller network ranges, you can just use nmap directly, there is no need to use JFScan. You can reach up to 70% of the speed of JFScan using the following options:*
```
nmap -Pn -n -v yourTargetNetwork/26 -p- --min-parallelism 64 --min-rate 20000 --min-hostgroup 64 --randomize-hosts -sS -sV
```
*As always, expect some false positivies/negatives.*
